When you have worked in a corporate environment, you know that deploying stuff can
be challenging.
During my work, I deployed [JetBrains Gateway](https://jetbrains.com/remote-development/gateway)
in a corporate environment. In this article, I will describe how I did it and what
I had to consider.

# What is JetBrains Gateway?

JetBrains Gateway is a piece of software that allows you to remotely access your
JetBrains IDEs, similarly to how you use [VSCode Remote Development](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/ssh).
With this, you can run your favorite JetBrains IDEs like IntelliJ IDEA or PyCharm
in :sparkles: the cloud :cloud::sparkles:.

# How it usually works

In an open environment that you have control over, the installation of JetBrains
Gateway is pretty straightforward.

- install the Gateway Client on your local machine
- add an SSH connection to your server that should run the IDE
- click on `Check Connection and Continue`
- select the IDE you want to install as well as the remote project directory
- click `Download IDE and Connect`
- and you're done :tada:

## Taking a closer look

What happens under the hood when you click on `Download IDE and Connect` is that
the Gateway application on your local machine tries to connect via SSH to the remote
server and then downloads your selected IDE from JetBrains' servers.
This IDE is actually the exact same version that you would download as an end-user
from JetBrains' website when you want to install PyCharm[^1] or IntelliJ IDEA[^2]
on your local machine.

If you look closely into the downloaded file, you will see that there is a `bin`
directory that contains a `remote-dev-server.sh` script.
This script is (more or less) what's executed on the remote server after your IDE
is downloaded.

# Corporate setup

In a corporate environment, you usually have to deal with proxies and firewalls.
In my case, I had the situation that in the environment to deploy Gateway in was
a docker container which I only had SSH access to.
The docker container itself had no internet access, but I could access the internet
from the host machine.

So I had to download the IDE from my local machine and then copy it into the
remote server.

```bash
scp pycharm-professional-2023.2.1.tar.gz remote-server:~/
ssh remote-server
tar xzf pycharm-professional-2023.2.1.tar.gz -C /opt
```

Additionally, the only directory that was persisted in the docker container was
my home directory which was mounted from a network share.
PyCharm (and probably the other JetBrains IDEs too) requires a persistent directory
to store its configuration and caches.
The configuration is stored in in `~/.config/JetBrains` by default and the caches
are stored in `~/.cache/JetBrains`.
Unfortunately, PyCharm does not like working on a network share at all[^3],
so I had to find a way to store the configuration and caches in a local directory
instead.
Creating a symlink from the network share to a local directory fixed the issue.

```bash
ln -s /tmp/jetbrains-cache ~/.cache/JetBrains
```

Since these are only cache files, we also won't lose any meaningful data if the
container is restarted.

So when you run this script, you will see some logging and after some time,
you will see the following message:

```blank
$ REMOTE_DEV_NON_INTERACTIVE=1 /opt/pycharm-2023.2.1/bin/remote-dev-server.sh run \
    "${project_dir}"
    --ssh-link-port 2222 \
    --ssh-link-host remote-server \
    --ssh-link-user remote-user \
    -l 0.0.0.0

...

You can now either open the http link in your browser which will open the
JetBrains Gateway app for you or you can use the Gateway link and paste it into
the Gateway app directly[^4].

And you're done! :rocket:

## Plugins and Drivers

What makes the JetBrains IDEs so powerful is the huge ecosystem of drivers and plugins.
These drivers and plugins are usually downloaded from the internet when you want
to install them.
In my case, I had no internet access, so I had to download them manually and copy
them into the container.

### Drivers

Drivers are usually project-specific and go into `~/.config/JetBrains`.
For example, when I want to download the Snowflake driver for a project in `~/project`,
the `snowflake-jdbc-3.13.27.jar` driver would need to go into

```blank
~/.config/JetBrains/RemoteDev-PY/_home_user_project/net/snowflake/snowflake-jdbc/3.13.27/snowflake-jdbc-3.13.27.jar
```

Which jar exactly is needed depends on the driver you want to install.
You can find the exact name of the jar from the IDE error logs.
These drivers are usually downloaded from maven central.
If your corporate environment has a maven mirror like Nexus or Artifactory,
you could maybe even download the driver from there instead.
You can also provide your IDE a custom JAR.

### Plugins

Plugins can be downloaded manually from the [JetBrains Website](https://plugins.jetbrains.com).
For example, if you want to install the [GitToolBox plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7499-gittoolbox),
you can just search for it on the website and download it for your IDE version.
The downloaded zip needs to be extracted to `~/.config/JetBrains/RemoteDev-PY/_home_user_project/plugins/gittoolbox/`.

You need to differentiate between host plugins and client plugins.
Host plugins are installed on the remote server and client plugins
can be installed on the local machine (mostly theme-related plugins).
For example, [GitToolBox](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7499-gittoolbox)
is a host plugin, but [IdeaVim](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/164-ideavim)
is a client plugin.

# Putting it all together

I'd like to end with a short summary of the steps that are needed to deploy
JetBrains Gateway in a corporate world.

- install the Gateway Client on your local machine
- download your ide from JetBrains' website
- `scp <ide>-<version>.tar.gz remote-server:~/`
- extract the tarball to your installation directory
- `ln -s /tmp/jetbrains-cache ~/.cache/JetBrains` (if `$HOME` is a network share)
- add drivers and plugins to `~/.config/JetBrains/RemoteDev-PY/_home_user_project/`[^5]
  (if needed)
- if you need a proxy on your local machine, configure it in the Gateway app
- run the `remote-dev-server.sh` script on the remote server
- ???
- profit!!! :money_with_wings:

[^4]: In corporate environments, it is usually the case that you cannot access the internet from your local machine directly but through a proxy. You may need to configure the proxy settings in the Gateway app. [px-proxy](https://github.com/genotrance/px) might come in handy if you use NTLM authentication since JetBrains products cannot handle this natively.
[^5]: You need to update the paths accordingly to your project directory. Also, `RemoteDev-PY` might be different for you depending on the IDE you want to use.
