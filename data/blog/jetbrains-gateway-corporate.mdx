# What is JetBrains Gateway?

JetBrains Gateway is a piece of software that allows you to remotely access your JetBrains IDEs,
similarly to how you use [VSCode Remote Development](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/ssh).
With this, you can run your favorite JetBrains IDEs like IntelliJ IDEA or PyCharm in the :sparkles: cloud :cloud::sparkles:.

# How it usually works

In an open environment that you have control over, the installation of JetBrains Gateway is pretty straightforward.

- install the Gateway Client on your local machine
- add an SSH connection to your server that should run the IDE
- click on `Check Connection and Continue`
- select the IDE you want to install as well as the remote project directory
- click `Download IDE and Connect`
- and you're done :tada:
